Methods - Exercise 2

What do the following expressions evaluate to?

1. x = 2
=> 2

This evaluates to 2, because 2 is assigned to the variable x.
This is implicit return.


2. puts x = 2
2
=> nil

the integer 2 is output because it's assigned to x, but nil is returned 
because puts will always return nil. 


3. p name = "Joe"
"Joe"
=> "Joe"
This outputs the string assigned to name, including the double quotes. 
p returns the value, rather than nil, which is what puts does.


4. four = "four"
"four"

Implicitly returns the value assigned to the variable four, which is the string "four".


5. print something = "nothing"
nothing => nil

print doesn't create a new line like puts does, so we get the output - the value
assigned to something (without quotes) - and the returned value nil on one line.
